**Project Description:**

Develop a web application to inform and encourage middle-housing development in response to WA House Bill 1110 (2023), which mandates the expansion of such developments in urban centers. This project seeks to give homeowners access to integral information on development opportunities and policy incentives in an intuitive data dashboard. By leveraging GIS and data visualizations, this project offers a comprehensive solution facilitating informed decision-making and fostering urban development.

**Summary of Concerns:**

*Technical Challenges*

The integration of GIS with dynamic data visualizations requires a comprehensive understanding of geospatial data and database design. Displaying this on a website while maintaining efficient runtime will require considerable thought, most likely requiring us to write dynamic API queries for a database. Additionally, building out a fully-fledged application requires a granular understanding of housing codes and ordinances, which are notoriously difficult to understand. These two challenges may result in the team having to choose one feature over another, depending on circumstance.

*Skills Gaps*

Developing knowledge of housing codes and various middle housing designs, such as those commercially available from Missing Middle Housing. Understanding the financial incentives and costs surrounding re-development to better understand users.

*Resource Constraints*

The dataset provided by the Puget Sound Regional Council is an amalgamation of various datasets used to inform policymakers and developers about middle housing initiatives. Understanding where this dataset came from, how more updated data can be obtained, and what each variable represents are a challenge, and restraint.
